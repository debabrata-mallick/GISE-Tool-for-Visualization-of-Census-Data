            We want to help college teachers to teach their students about visualizing and analyzing census data. This is a tutorial-based website where teachers can teach students about the Maharashtra household amenities District, Taluka, and Village level
            Map, which are based on 2011 Census data of Maharashtra. Also, this site has combined the original dataset with geospatial vector data format files so that students can do some of their own analyses based on their needs in the near future. Where
            all the attributes of all this census data will be available and their explanation, with all this Map, also has some Histograms and some Scatter plots of those Census data. To understand all this, this site has a proper explanation for them. We
            also provide this All Map original dataset with geospatial vector data format so that the student can download it on their local PC and play with them, and there will be instructions so that they can do some of their own analysis. Also, have some
            pre-given homework or exercise to do for students to identify their learning levels and evaluate them. May also include some case studies.

                    A Geographic Information System (GIS) captures, stores, analyzes, manages, and presents data that are linked to various location(s), Districts, Sub-Districts, Villages, etc., on a digital map. GIS can be used across multiple industries to understand trends and relationships with respect to a geographic context. This understanding aids management and decision-making.

The census provides data on the country's population, including its size, distribution, socioeconomic, demographic, household, and other characteristics.

                    The census data is utilized by the government, NGOs, researchers, commercial and private organizations, etc., for administration, planning, policymaking, as well as management, and assessment of numerous programs. Census data is used by researchers and demographers to assess population growth and trends and develop estimates. The census data is also vital for businesses and sectors to enhance and plan their operations in order to expand into previously untapped markets.

<h2>Percentage of Households to Total Households by Amenities and Assets of Maharashtra</h2>
For households, we have three tables, and all of them have the exact attributes. Only the difference is that for scheduled caste and scheduled tribes, we have taluka level data, and for general, we have village-level data; moreover, for this below, adding only one table to identify their key attributes, main attributes, sub-attributes, and bottom attributes.
<h4>For Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes Key Attributes is: Tehsil Code (Total, Rural, Urban) and   District Census Code <br>
    For General Key Attributes is: Town Code/Village code, Tehsil Code (Total, Rural, Urban) and   District Census Code
