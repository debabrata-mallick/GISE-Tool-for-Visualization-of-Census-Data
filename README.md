# GISE-Tool-for-Visualization-of-Census-Data
We want to help college teachers to teach their students about visualizing and analyzing census data. This is a tutorial-based website where teachers can teach students about the Maharashtra household amenities District, Taluka, and Village level Map, which are based on 2011 Census data of Maharashtra. Also, this site has combined the original dataset with geospatial vector data format files so that students can do some of their own analyses based on their needs in the near future. Where all the attributes of all this census data will be available and their explanation, with all this Map, also has some Histograms and some Scatter plots of those Census data. To understand all this, this site has a proper explanation for them. We also provide this All Map original dataset with geospatial vector data format so that the student can download it on their local PC and play with them, and there will be instructions so that they can do some of their own analysis. Also, have some pre-given homework or exercise to do for students to identify their learning levels and evaluate them. May also include some case studies.
