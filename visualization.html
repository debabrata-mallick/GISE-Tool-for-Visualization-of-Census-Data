        Some Analysis of Maharashtra Households Amenities Data
    </b>
</h2>

<p style="font-size:20px; color: rgb(58, 1, 1);" align="center">
    <b style="margin: 1.5cm;"> As we have several data types like district, taluka, village, and town level (Total, Rural,
        and Urban) for Demography and Households, we can do several combinations of analyses
        based on our requirements. However, for demonstration here, we are just adding some analysis
        only for taluka level households condition of census house. Households condition of Census
        House has several secondary attributes even though these secondary attributes have several
        bottom attributes to explain the good condition of census houses elaborately on that time. </b> 
</p>


<p style="font-size:20px; color: rgb(58, 1, 1);" align="center">
    <b style="margin: 1.5cm;"> Now adding several combinations of the histogram for understanding the number of
        households good condition of the census house from households by amenities of General, Scheduled
        Caste, and Scheduled Tribes (Total/Rural/Urban). </b>

<p style="font-size:20px; color: rgb(58, 1, 1);" align="center">
    <b style="margin: 1.5cm;"> Below is an example of the percentage of census general (Total/Rural/Urban)
        good condition houses. We can see that on average most of the taluka have more than
        50 percent good houses, but urban taluka have more good condition houses than rural
        taluka good houses. </b>

    <b style="margin: 1.5cm;"> Below is an example of the percentage of census Scheduled Caste (Total/Rural/Urban)
        good condition houses. Most of the total and Rural taluka have between 30 to 70 percent
        good condition, but in urban the situation is different. For urban, most of the taluka
        has good condition houses in between 40 to 85 percent. So we can say the Scheduled
        Caste urban taluka has a higher percentage of good condition houses as compared with
        total and rural. </b>

        good condition, but in urban the situation is different. For urban, most of the taluka
        has good condition houses in between 30 to 96 percent. So we can say the Scheduled
        Tribe urban taluka has a higher percentage of good condition houses as compared with
