        <b style="margin: 1.5cm;"> The above data set are given only to know about the original source of data that we used. After collecting all those data, we notice that there is 35 district in a separate file. So we combine all 35 district data in a single CSV so that we can extract the data we need for District, Taluka, and Village levels for Total, Rural and Urban. These are those combined file data set links are for (please click on the given link to download the combain dataset):

        From Marged Excel File If anytime need a specific district data, just need to put a filter in DT Name ( District Name) column. From this, also get specific district block-wise data. In Town/Village, select only 0 or Level; if we select CD Block, then we get all district rural, urban, and total Population Details. Then in the TRU column, if we use a filter, we can get all Maharastra Total, Rural, or Urban all the details based on our need. Even Level column, we can quickly get all Maharastra 278 Town and 43665 Vliiages CD Block wise all details.
